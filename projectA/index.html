                <p>Despair Rustblock</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Dr. KK, 3028</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>The Rustblock belongs to the Rustblock Family, a lineage not born of natural reproduction but through a unique phenomenon: the emotional rupture of a predecessor. When a Rustblock experiences overwhelming emotional impact, it fractures—and from the shards, a new Rustblock emerges. Each offspring develops its own emotional preference, which in turn influences its growth rate, physical form, and emotional abilities.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The Rustblock family resides in the depths of mist-shrouded lakes, where the surface remains mirror-like, reflecting only a blurred semblance of the sky above. These lakes are known as Echo Lakes—mythical bodies of water said to retain the final emotional residue of all lifeforms that have perished within them. Rustblocks grow silently, embedded in the rocky lakebed, and only emerge when triggered by intense emotional fluctuations in their surroundings.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>This entity manifests as a slightly distorted cube, with soft, shifting edges that seem to ripple or tremble as if alive. Its dominant coloration is deep black, yet within its form, a slow, ink-like movement can be seen, as if liquid emotions are circulating beneath the surface.
                    In moments of emotional intensity, the cube secretes a vivid red substance—resembling either blood or pigment—that slowly stains the surrounding water. Its body gently expands and contracts with a breathing rhythm, evoking a strange, biomorphic sense of life.

                This blackened, fully matured specimen has been classified as The Despair Rustblock, the most dangerous entity known in the Rustblock Family. It not only absorbs despair but also stores and amplifies it, potentially releasing it in bursts that cause psychological disturbances in nearby organisms.
                Several researchers have reported symptoms such as emotional numbness, auditory hallucinations, and moderate depression after prolonged exposure. Some required psychological care or isolation following their interaction.
                Its behavioral patterns resemble those of a sentient psychic symbiont, challenging the boundary between biological entity and emotional parasite.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                1.Keep Emotionally Unstable Individuals Away: The Despair Rustblock targets emotionally vulnerable people and rapidly establishes resonance with them.

                2.Limit Exposure Duration: Close observation should not exceed 3 minutes. Emotional neutralizers or sensory-disruption headsets are mandatory.
                
                3.Psychological Screening Required: All personnel must pass a mental health evaluation before interacting with the entity.
                
                4.Watch for Environmental Indicators: A red tint in surrounding water is an early warning sign of activation. Immediate evacuation is advised.
                
                5.No Resonance Testing: Attempts to trigger resonance or emotional discharge are strictly prohibited outside of controlled laboratory settings.
